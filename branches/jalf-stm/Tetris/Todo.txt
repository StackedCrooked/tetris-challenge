STM Version
-----------
- On Mac the FPS is very slow.
v Use STM in TreeRowInfos
v Future blocks shows current block as next block.
v Check out Google Perftools (http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/wiki/GooglePerformanceTools)
v Remove Computer's dependency to MainThread.
v There is something wrong with the block types: BlockType_I appears twice.
v Restore unit-test build.
v Fix the working of the program
v Improve encapsulation by obeying the Law of Demeter


STM Notes
---------
- stm::shared<std::string> s(std::string()); // a little weird

@StackedCrooked btw, if you need something like a condition variable in the STM lib,
simply open the variables you want to wait for changes in, check their value, and
call transaction::retry(). In an ideal world, it'd then suspend the thread until
one of your opened variables is modified. In the current implementation, it's basically
a busy loop, so much less efficient, but the effect is the same :)
