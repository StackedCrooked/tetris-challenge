- Remove Poco dependencies
- Console application to test AI
- Report the boost deadlock when version > 1.42
- Use googletest
- Highscores (offline or online)
- Seamless cross-platform builds: Mac OS X, Linux and Windows
- Associate computer names with strategies.
- Use a single shared timer.
- Game state comparator could shuffle in case of equal
? Game concept: Computer is allowed to make a move after the player made one.
v Paint GameOver instead of showing a MessageBox
v Use Ctrl-P for pause.
v On startup the new game dialog should popup.
v Use a "New game"-dialog with game options.
v Add a toolbar
v Use computer avatars
v Icon
v Mac Bundle
v Computer drop should also work.
v Show FPS
v Implement Human vs Computer modus.
v Sometimes penalty appears on the top of the grid. (Usually when game was already high, and tetris penalty.)
v Sometimes AI seems to be dead. It just doesn't do anything anymore, letting all blocks slowly drop to the floor.
v Fix random seeds.
v Fix unittest build.
v QtTetris: paint stats
v Differentiate between Human and Computer game objects.
v Introduce ScopedReader and ScopedWriter. Use read lock for the ScopedReader.
v Rename TetrisCore to Tetris
v Add checkbox: 'switch to Survive when height reaches xx%'
v Add multicore search and add spin button to GUI to specify number of threads.
v Don't use boost::shared_ptr for WorkerPool.
v Make Mac build of the TetrisCoreTestSuite
v CMake: try to make it work for Mac and Linux.
v Fix memory leak (memory keeps growing in the GUI test, according to the Windows Task Manager).
v Make TetrisCore compilation faster by using forward declares.
v Move the AI code in the Controller::refresh() method to a Tetris::ComputerPlayer class.
v On Wine (Linux) the combobox height is item to short. XULWin issue?
v Add menulist for AI preset
v Rename NodeCalculator to NodeCalculator.
x Concurrent node calculation (create first generation of childnodes and then use a thread per child)
v Use Tetris icon on the exe file.
v SpinButton -> implement a refresh when keeping the mouse button down
v GUI shows current search depth
v Fix bug where the precalculated node does not line up with the current game state.
v Pruning
v NodeCalculator class: specifying a time limit should be non-intrusive. Use a Concept (or Decorator).
v BlockMover should only be created once. It should not be destroyed and recreated every time.
v Fix stack overflow when deleting a node that goes very deep.
v Fix deadlock issue in BlockMover:
v Implement level increment (doesn't work currently)
v Add AI movement speed parameter.
v Use up/down control for modifying AI parameters.
v Implement various selectable "Strategies" for AI
v Add the tetris icon to the credits section (about dialog)
v Strategy selector: implement a DECENT event handler for the menu handler AND the menupopup
v Hyperlink in about dialog
v About dialog
v Window icon
v Show menu with "New game", "About", etc..
v Use Tetris/Game.h include structure.
v Replace ThreadSafe<Game> with ThreadSafe<Game>.
v Stop cheating
v Logger scroll to bottom
v Fix Game Over crash
v Use official Tetris colors
v AI thinks while block mover is doing his thing
v Delete JobRunner.h and .cpp
v Non-blocking visual NodeCalculator
