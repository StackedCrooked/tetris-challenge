STM Version
-----------
- Setup Valgrind script for memcheck, drd, helgrind, etc...
- Use STM in TreeRowInfos
- Future blocks shows current block as next block.
- Redesign Model, MultiplayerGame, Player classes.
v Remove Computer's dependency to MainThread.
v There is something wrong with the block types: BlockType_I appears twice.
v Restore unit-test build.
v Fix the working of the program
v Improve encapsulation by obeying the Law of Demeter


STM Notes
---------
stm::shared<std::string> s(std::string()); // a little weird

@StackedCrooked btw, if you need something like a condition variable in the STM lib, simply open the variables you want to wait for changes in, check their value, and call transaction::retry(). In an ideal world, it'd then suspend the thread until one of your opened variables is modified. In the current implementation, it's basically a busy loop, so much less efficient, but the effect is the same :)
