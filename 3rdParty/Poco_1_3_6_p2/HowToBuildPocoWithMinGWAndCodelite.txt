Build Poco with MinGW and Codelite
----------------------------------
- Open cmd.exe and cd to the Poco directory.
- Run premake4 and use codelite or codeblocks as action:
    premake4 codelite
- Open codelite and build the projects.
- Make sure the Foundation project selects the gcc compiler, not the g++ compiler because zlib compilation fails with g++.
- Make sure you use the latest version of MinGW! Don't use the version that is shipped with Codelite or Code::Blocks
